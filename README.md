This is a skeleton for how to do a yacc/bison project without problems.

You should also read the manuals:
[flex](https://westes.github.io/flex/manual/)
[bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/index.html)

TODO integrate this with my [makefile-demo project](https://github.com/o11c/makefile-demo), which does more things automagically.
